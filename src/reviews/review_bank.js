                    She is gentle and patient with my pup as she is getting up there in age.  
                    My dog is always excited to see Jenn.  Our whole family loves her sparkling personality. 
                    We highly recommended Zen Room Grooming`

        message: `I took a 2 week vacation and this was the first time I had spent more than one day away from my kitties, one of which being only 3 months old.  
        Needless to say I was really concerned about being away that long. Jen made sure to get their routine, needs, likes, dislikes, 
        quirks etc down prior to me leaving.  I received consistent pictures, videos and communication which significantly eased my stresses. 
        She took the time to make sure they ate, drank water, kept a clean box and spent time playing with them before leaving.  
        I offered my home to her if she wanted to spend a night with them as well and she left the house in the condition I left it. 
        The baby kitten ended up with a ring worm infection and Jen caught the early symptoms, sent photos, administered his medications and 
        monitored his progress. Before I left, we discussed my times of departure and arrival to ensure they wouldn't go more than 12 hours 
        without being checked on/fed.  Jen has a genuine love for animals and it shows with how they respond to her. 
        I highly recommend her for your pet care/sitting needs.`

        message: `Jenn is just simply the best. I rescued my little girl Gabriella from a very traumatic situation and she was terrified of everything and everyone, 
        especially groomers. Jenn won her over the first time they met. Her kind, loving and nurturing approach to animals is amazing. 
        Plus, she adds in some magic like lavender essential oil, bath time massage, gentle kind and loving words and soothing CBD. 
        The end results are a beautifully groomed dog who has just enjoyed a very pleasant day at the spa.`

        message: `Jenn has been our groomer for close to two years now. We have a Great Pyrenees and Jenn has been the only groomer for Ellie. 
        The bond that they have is so amazing, and every groom is perfect. She's even helped with our other two large dogs, both Doberman/Shepherd mixes. 
        The attention to detail and compassion that Jenn has are just a few reasons why we will continue to go to Jenn for all of our grooming needs.`

        message: `Jenn Joyce  is the best dog groomer-dog sitter . If your looking for someone to take great care of your pups, she’s your gal. 
        She dog sits and grooms our 2 boxers and Pomeranian. She takes great pride in her work and has that touch that all animals just love her. 
         What I love the best is that she will come to your home to groom and doggie sit. If you have a nervous dogs she keeps your pups at home feeling safe. 
         My lil Pom is very nervous and she’s able to keep him calm and does an amazing job on making his coat look nice and fluffy. 
         She also offers cbd for dogs to keep them calm during their session. I wouldn’t trust my dogs with anyone else. Highly recommend!`
